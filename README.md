# SoftActorCriticAutonomousCar
Things to do:
1. Add IMU plugin to the model and gazebo file
2. Fetch more world environments from gazebo repo (Training and Testing)
3. Develop the scripts for interfacing OpenAIgym with Gazebo
4. Prototype the script for SAC using Pytorch
5. Develop node on Arduino to fetch sensor readings from wheel-encoders and HC-SR04
6. Fuse sensor readings from IMU and Arduino-connected sensors on Jetson nano using EKF and robot_localization_package
7. Develop script to deploy on skid_steer_robot
